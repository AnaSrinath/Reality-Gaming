# Reality-Gaming

This project is aimed at developing a movement-tracking game controller allowing the Bilaterally Imputed (A person who is missing or has had amputated either both arms or both legs) to play games without having to worry about using their arms/legs. It also enables regular users to engage in a game with more interest and therefore, further enjoy the gaming experience.
